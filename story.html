            <h6>The journey begins in the Spring of 2018 at the University of Texas at Dallas. Mariah, a student at Southern Methodist University, was visiting a high school friend who happened to live just a few doors down from Aaron in the dorm.
                That semester, Mariah visited UTD often and quickly became a member of the Computer and Electrical Engineering friend group that Aaron was a part of. The group frequently played ultimate frisbee in the dorm courtyard and hung out
                in the common areas. If you ask Aaron, the first time he took notice of Mariah was the first game of ultimate frisbee she participated in. He thought it was so funny how much energy she had and how cute she was chasing after the frisbee
                regardless of who had it or who it was being thrown to. That same day, Mariah was also showing off her "party trick" which is pistol squatting. As much as Aaron tried to repeat the action, the results remained the same, he was able to go down
                but always struggled to push back up. The first time Mariah took notice of Aaron was when she and her high school friend, Prathyusha were cooking in the UTD dorm kitchen as Aaron got home from his job as a waiter. They caught up for a bit 
                which was their longest conversation up to that point. She thought he was really cute and asked Prathyusha after he left if he was single and would possibly be interested.
            </h6>
            <h6>They remained friends for another year as they both got busy and Mariah was not able to visit UTD as much. </h6>
